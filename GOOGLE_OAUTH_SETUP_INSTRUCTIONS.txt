GOOGLE OAUTH CONFIGURATION - REQUIRED STEPS
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
Error: "The given origin is not allowed for the given client ID"

This means your Google OAuth Client ID is not configured to accept requests 
from your current website origin.

SOLUTION - Configure Google Cloud Console:
-------------------------------------------

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

2. Find and click on your OAuth 2.0 Client ID:
   Client ID: 283246214071-eqctr8egt9snucarjlsig6o2rbg9aqe2.apps.googleusercontent.com

3. In the "Authorized JavaScript origins" section, ADD these URLs:
   
   For Local Development:
   ✓ http://localhost:3000
   ✓ http://127.0.0.1:3000
   
   For Production (Railway):
   ✓ https://web-production-11e43.up.railway.app
   
   IMPORTANT: Do NOT include trailing slashes or paths!

4. In the "Authorized redirect URIs" section, ADD these URLs:
   
   For Local Development:
   ✓ http://localhost:3000/
   ✓ http://127.0.0.1:3000/
   
   For Production (Railway):
   ✓ https://web-production-11e43.up.railway.app/
   ✓ https://web-production-11e43.up.railway.app/api/accounts/google-login/

5. Click "SAVE" at the bottom of the page

6. Wait 5-10 minutes for Google's changes to propagate

7. Clear your browser cache and try again


VERIFICATION:
-------------
After making these changes, you should see:
- ✓ No more "origin not allowed" errors
- ✓ Google Sign-In button works properly
- ✓ Successful authentication and redirect

CURRENT STATUS:
---------------
Based on the screenshots you provided, your Google Console currently has:
- Multiple localhost and Railway URLs already added
- But the specific production URL might be missing or incorrect

Double-check that:
✓ https://web-production-11e43.up.railway.app is in Authorized JavaScript origins
✓ No typos in the URL
✓ No extra spaces or characters
✓ Changes have been saved

ADDITIONAL TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

If you still get 500 errors after fixing the origin issue:

1. Check backend logs on Railway for detailed error messages
2. Verify GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID is set in Railway environment variables
3. Ensure the Client ID in frontend matches the one in backend .env
4. Restart your Railway deployment after making changes

Need help? The backend now has detailed logging that will show:
